				<h3>Prevalence and Employability Statistic</h3>
				<p>

					<br>Source: Our World in Data, 2016 (IMHE, Global Burden of Disease)						
				</p>
				<p>
					Neuro Developmental Disorders including Intellectual Disability is the disability with the highest level of unemployment. There’s no employability statistic available in India. In the US, it is 85 to 90%!
				</p>
				<p>
					The reason for the alarmingly high number, is because we have focused on the disabilities and not on their abilities and strengths.
				</p>
				<h3>Upside of employing Neuro-divergents</h3>

					graphic designing, proof-reading and many others and have proved to be more successful than their typical counterparts.

					the box solutions which are required to sustain competitive advantage.

				</p>
				<p>
					They prefer repetitive tasks and can be an asset for jobs involving routinized work with minimal or no novelty, which might be a challenge to find among neuro typicals. Lemon Tree Chain of hotels feel they not only 
					reduce cost of recruitment and training as attrition rates are significantly lower but also ensure high precision and perfection at their tasks.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is but the tip of the iceberg. The return on investment is truly huge. 
				</p>
				<p>
					With a neuro-divergent team member, co-workers enhance their communication and interpersonal skills that include empathy, flexibility and resilience. Managers leverage managerial and leadership competencies, 
					become effective communicators and great change agents.
				</p>
				<p>
					With a confident positive workforce and a work culture, embracing innovation and change, organizations will thrive as strategic leaders, setting new benchmarks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Enterprises will see business impact with tangible outcomes, from their investments into the neurodiversity movement. 
				</p>
				<h3>Can India set the trend</h3>
				<p>
					Over centuries India has embraced diversity in all forms and has grown stronger as a nation. Tolerance and embracing diversity is a part of the Indian DNA.
				</p>
				<p>
					By challenging assumptions and stereotypes, let’s showcase to the world a landmark socio economic endeavor by creating a neuro diverse society, 
					where individuals are respected and encouraged to be different.
